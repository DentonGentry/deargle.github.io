title: Was almost certain this was an Experian postal phish

I froze my credit in the wake of the Equifax breach. Got two letters in the mail today, one for me and one for my wife, that I strongly suspected was a phishing scam. I 
don't recall asking to have our names removed from receiving preapproved credit offers for five years, but I suppose it could have been part of the freeze process and I just
dind't notice. Google searching
for the P.O. box showed me it's legit. Go figure. At any rate, it's a good idea for a phishing scam with the credit bureaus in the news lately. Letter below.
