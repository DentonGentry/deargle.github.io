title: I received a blackmail letter
description:
---


Got something very interesting in the mail a few days ago -- a blackmail letter! Claiming that someone discovered that I have been unfaithful to my wife (which I haven't been, I assure you). Obviously a phishing scam, but while these kinds of things may be common in email spamboxes, when USPS is used, it's a felony. I did some research and it looks very much like a copycat of [the Ashley Madison blackmail letters](https://www.grahamcluley.com/ashley-madison-blackmail-letter/) that went out last December, except the version I received only requires a name and an address. My name was only mentioned twice, and no other names were named. I'm attaching redacted copies.

Compare the letter I received (below) to the Ashley Madison one linked above.

* The line spacing within-paragraph is the same, 
* the font face is the same, 
* the spacing between paragraphs is the same (which is noteworthy since it's rather large spacing), 
* the requested amount ($2k) is exactly the same except that my version includes a comma in the number figure, 
* the language and font styling describing the "Receiving Bitcoin Address" is exactly the same, as is the wording from that point onward about things like "payment must be received by..." 
* the "THIS DOCUMENT IS TWO-SIDED" language on the bottom is also identical, although mine is right-aligned. Etcetera. 

It's such a close match that it's obviously related to AM, but who would have taken the time to start with a physical letter and then match the formatting exactly in their own word template? Doesn't make sense, unless there's just one guy doing all this, which I doubt. I suspect that the digital file template that was used in the original AM blackmails is being shared on the darkwebs, although I haven't ventured out to confirm. Sharing of source material is common, especially when the originator is feeling the heat and needs plausible deniability. [Happened with the Mirai IoT Botnet source code](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/).

The envelope used a physical stamp, and was sent from "Pittsburgh 150." Impossible to say exactly where that is, but 150 is the first three in the 5-digit zip for the wide Pittsburgh region. I sent my original copy to the Pittsburgh US Postal Inspector, and I also filed a report with my local borough police in case these guys are shot-gunning letters to everyone in the neighborhood. It kind of unnerves me to imagine someone as nearby as downtown taking the time to stuff the envelope and drop it in the mailbox with my name on it, though. The day I received it, I found myself on edge when cars slowed down in front of our house. I suspect they got my address from the same place that junk mailers got it from. We'll see what the inspector general finds, if anything. I doubt they'll get much from the letter I sent them since I handled it so much, but maybe they'll find something somewhere else.

On the cost issue from the perspective of the attacker: I'd be curious to know the response rates to postal letters versus spam emails, if the exact same message were sent out. I'd naturally predict that postal response rates would be much higher. But how much higher do they need to be, economically speaking? I'm having trouble finding an exact number (I know it's in Brian Kreb's _Spam Nation_, amazing book by the way), but an old estimate I found is that spam costs [$0.00001 per email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam#Cost_of_spam). So the response rate to a physical letter has to be at least 44,000 times higher than for a single spam email in order for it to make financial sense. I wouldn't be surprised if it were. At 50 cents each and at 2k payout you'd only need a response rate of 1/4000 in order to break even.

Other considerations are that, for the letter I received, the attacker had to know that I am currently married, to a woman. They did not need to know my gender. My next curiosity is to see what's available in the way of address list specificity. Maybe there is a specific list of "addresses of people married to a woman." That'd be interesting. I'd also be interested to see what the street value is of each bit of information, e.g. the price of an address, birthday, home ownership status, credit cards owned, web searching behavior, etc. But I need to prepare a bit more before I delve into the darkwebs. vpn, tor, etc.

As for whether I match an AM profile, I'd suspect that if I did, I would have gotten the AM-specific letter, but who knows.

**Update 11/9/2016:** I made a first foray into the darkweb using [Tor running on Tails in a VM](https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html) (on a usb stick soon), but I didn't find anything yet.


**Update 10/27/2017:** I got three emails today from other victims. I have only received one other email in the 12-ish months that this post has been up. Seems like another wave has gone out.


**Update 10/28/2017:** I have now received 8 emails from victims since yesterday. There's definitely been another wave. At least five were postmarked "Nashville, Tennessee 370." Several didn't have the stamp cancelled out. Recipients are all over the US:

* Portland, Oregon
* Alabama
* California (Unknown + Southern + San Francisco)
* Fort Myers, Florida
* Houston, Texas
* Austin, Texas
* Chandler, Arizona
* Cincinnati, Ohio
* Annandale, Virginia
* Wilmington, Delaware
* Seattle, Washington
* Nashville, Tennessee (!)
* York, Maine (a detective from the York police department reached out to me for that one)

All postmarked October 24, 2017.

Bitcoin addresses are unique.

By the way, nothing ever came from me ignoring the original letter I received.

If you're a victim too, if you'd be so kind, please shoot me an email with your general location, and whether the post office stamp was also Nashville, Tennessee 370. ~~I'm also still looking for a full scan of the new letter -- apparently there are some changes, further supporting the idea that there's a Word document floating around.~~ Scan received, see link at bottom of this post. Mostly identical, with two differences:

* First sentence is "I know about the secret you are keeping from your wife" instead of "I know you cheated on your wife."
* There's a reference to "I stumbled across your misadventures while working a job around [location close to victim's address]", whereas before the location was not specified.

I know my name (all our names) are on a lot of lists for sale out there (the same lists that junk mailers use), but I still wonder, which list did the scammer use for this? Knowing that would answer the question -- "why me?". Probably just a mundane "people who are married" list of some kind, with random selection from the list. It's not even a "people who are married and who probably have $2,000 to spare" list, because I got targeted when I was a doctoral student ¯\\\_ツ\_/¯. 

The other thing is that before, I got a letter postmarked from my local city (which was unnerving). So did another victim who contacted me last year. I wonder how the attacker pulled that off. Are there such things as local letter-sending mules? But this time, it's all from Nashville?

A friend recommended I post some of the text of the letter for SEO purposes (to help victims find this post), so here goes with the first two paragraphs:

> I'm going to cut to the chase. I know about the secret you are keeping from your wife. More importantly, I have _evidence_ of what you have been hidnig. I won't go into the specifics here in case your wife intercepts this, but you know what I am talking about.

> You don't know me personally and nobody hired me to look into you. Nor did I go out looking to burn you. It is just your bad luck that I stumbled across your misadventures while working a job around [redacted]. I then put in more time than I probably should have looking into your life. Frankly, I am ready to forget all about you and let you get on with your life. And I am going to give you two options that will accomplish that very thing. Those two options are either to ignore this letter, or simply pay me $2,000. Let's examine those two options in more details.

And so on.
