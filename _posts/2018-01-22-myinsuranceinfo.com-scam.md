Got the below letter in the mail Saturday night. It claims to be from the credit union that services our vehicle loan. It says that our insurance information is not current, and if we do not quickly provide our up-to-date insurance information to them, they may purchase insurance on our behalf. 

> Dear [Me]:

> A recent review of your loan file indicates that [my credit union] does not have a current copy of your physical damage insurance for the collateral listed below. The terms of your loan agreement require you to maintain this coverage on your collateral at all times.

> Please furnish evidence of insurance that meets the following conditions. We will be unable to accept insurance information that does not meet all of these conditions.

> * [uninteresting conditions]

> For your convenience, you or your insurance agent may furnish evidence of insurance in the following ways:

> * [uninteresting ways]

> In the event we do not receive evidence of your insurance coverage, we may purchase insurance on your belaf. You may want to avoid this action by providing proof of coverage.

> If you have any questions about this notice, please call our Insurance Service Center at 1(800)998-0763. Thank you for allowing us to serve you.

> Sincerely,

I was a bit distracted at the time of opening the letter, and it stressed me out -- another thing on my todo list. I admit that at first, I intended to respond and submit our
insurance information, but I was still hesitant. Why would my credit union be using an external company to process insurance information?

Thankfully I put it off until Monday, when I was fresher. Googled the name of the website and came
across [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/6vkatb/myinsuranceinfocom/), tipping me off to check out the loan number. The loan number was incorrect. The VIN is correct, though. (Redacted, although hey, you could likely find it too.) Phone number didn't match up with our credit union. Phone number is also posted to some site called [GoSafco](http://www.gosafco.com/customers/automobile-insurance/), supposedly for some automotive insurance company called Safco. web.archive.org says the site has been online since 2012. They helpfully offer this advice on their website:

> If you have received a notice regarding your insurance policy cancellation, a letter stating we need proof of insurance, or a non-renewal letter, please provide us with a copy of your insurance policy. You can FAX it to: 1-866-319-1597 or call 1-800-998-0763.  You may also email the information to MyInsurance@GoSAFCO.com

No thanks.

The site ([gosafco.com](gosafco.com)) is pretty thorough for a scam site, and free of typos. There's another company called Safco that [sells office products](http://www.safcoproducts.com/) and that has [Glassdoor reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-SAFCo-EI_IE691184.11,16.htm), so I think that SafCO _is_ legit.

Be careful out there, it's a scammy world. (But most people are good.)
