#### Software

We will use [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) for data modeling and SQL execution (available on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X). Macintosh owners can also use [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) for SQL execution.

#### MySQL database
1. Laptop for individual assignments and exams <br>
   [MySQL Community Server](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (or, if you're interested in Web Dev, [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/))<br>
1. Server for group work <br>
   Hostname: TBA. You will get a group id and password.

#### R
1. Server connection parameters TBA

#### Group size
Groups should contain between three and four persons.

#### Academic honesty
Students in this course will be expected to comply with the [University of Pittsburgh's Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.cfo.pitt.edu/policies/policy/02/02-03-02.html). Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity. This may include, but is not limited to, the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of violating University Policy. Furthermore, no student may bring any unauthorized materials to an exam, including dictionaries and programmable calculators.

#### Team work
In this class, you will work in teams. As a result, review a short report on [team effectiveness]({{site.baseurl}}/class/general/team_effectiveness.pdf) and establish a team agreement [(sample agreement)]({{ site.baseurl }}/class/general/sample_team_agreement.docx). Give the instructor a copy of your team agreement by the end of the second week of classes.


#### Freeloader policy
It occasionally happens in class and enterprise settings that someone in a group is not prepared to do his/her share. In the case of my classes, I recommend that the team give the freeloader one warning and then fire that person from the team. That person will then do group assignments individually or find another team to join. The team should notify me of the change in team composition immediately. I distribute a [form]({{site.baseurl}}/class/general/Peereval.docx) to assess team participation at the end of the semester. If a major disparity in team contribution is reported, I will adjust team project grades.

#### Laptop policy 
Students are welcome to use laptops in class for note taking and completing class exercises, exclusively. If you plan to take notes, please advise and email a copy of the notes at the end of each class.


#### Attendance
Attendance and participation are required for this course. Excessive unexcused absences (i.e., greater than 4) will result in a failing grade according to [University of Pittsburgh policies](http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/archive/education/eh.html)

#### Assignments
See the class schedule for the due date. The due time is 11:59pm on the due date.

#### Exercises
* SQL exercises are based on the [ClassicModels database](http://richardtwatson.com/dm6e/Reader/ClassicModels.html).
* Please use the assignment identifier so I can keep track of your submissions. As I have many assignments to grade, help me to be efficient.
* **Resubmission**: If you receive less than full points for an exercise, you can make one resubmission up to one week after the intital due date for the first three assignments.
* Please use eLC dropbox and follow the specificied [guidelines](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/general/dmassignmentsV2.html).
