title: Lab &ndash; Threat Modeling with Attack Trees
number: 1
---
 
Note: you can do this assignment alone or in groups of 2–3.

In this lab, you will create attack trees for different attacker goals to help you systematically think through various attacks. You can represent your attack tree graphically (like those depicted in Schneier Chapter 21), or as a numbered list (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3, …). The below questions are in part from Cryptography Engineering, 2nd edition, by Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno (2010).

Note: You can use Microsoft Word’s SmartArt function and the "hierarchy" template to quickly generate an attack tree from an outline. 

1. Create an attack tree for stealing a car, and show your work. Which attack is easiest for the attacker? Which attack poses the least amount of risk for the attacker?
2. Create an attack tree for getting into a gym without paying. Which attack do you think is most likely?
3. Create an attack tree for reading someone else’s email. Assign a difficulty level to each attack node, per Schneier Chapter 21. Which attack requires the least sophistication on the part of the attacker? Which attack requires the greatest expertise? What types of attackers do you think would use either attack?
4. Create an attack tree for learning someone’s online banking account name and password. Assign dollar values to each attack node, per Schneier Chapter 21. Which attack is cheapest for the attacker? Which attack is most expensive?

Submit your assignment online. If working in a group, include all group member names in the document, but only have one group 
member submit the document.

## Q&A

Q: Do we have to put in numbers in the boxes for probability, cost, etc, just like in the reading?
: A: You don't have to do exactly what the examples in the reading example had, but you should come up with some kind of metric and value for each box to justify your answer to the questions. For example,
	for the first question, you should have metrics representing 'ease' and 'risk' so that you can answer the question. Defend your ranking and answers. e.g., "We think that \_\_\_\_ would be the easiest because \_\_\_\_\_, whereas \_\_\_\_\_ would not be as easy because \_\_\_\_\_."
